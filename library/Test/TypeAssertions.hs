-- | This module provides a set of runtime assertions about types that
-- propogates information back to the type system, using 'Typeable' and ':~:'.
-- These are intended to be used in a test suite (and exclusively in a test
-- suite) to create monomorphic implementations of polymorphic functions.
-- Specifically, this is intended to be used with a package like
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/test-fixture test-fixture> to stub out
-- polymorphic typeclass methods with monomorphic implementations.
--
-- For example, consider the following typeclass:
--
-- > class Monad m => MonadDB m where
-- >   get :: DBRecord r => Id r -> m [r]
-- >   ...
--
-- The @get@ method might be used in another function to retrieve a record of a
-- specific type, such as a @User@. In a test, it might be useful to stub out
-- the @get@ method to provide a well-known user:
--
-- > let fixture = def { _get = \_ -> User { ... } }
--
-- However, this will not typecheck, since the type of record should be chosen
-- by the /caller/ of @get@. We might know that the type is guaranteed to be
-- @User@ in this particular case, but GHC cannot prove that, and it will reject
-- attempts to write a stubbed implementation.
--
-- To work around this issue, we can effectively defer the type error to runtime
-- by using the functions in this module. For example, we can use
-- 'withAssertEqT' to assert that the types are the same:
--
-- > {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables, TypeApplications #-}
-- >
-- > let fixture = def { _get = \(_ :: Id r) ->
-- >       withAssertEqT @r @User $
-- >         User { ... } }
--
-- This will properly convince GHC that the @User@ value will only be returned
-- when the argument is actually an @Id User@. If it isn’t, 'withAssertEqT' will
-- throw.
